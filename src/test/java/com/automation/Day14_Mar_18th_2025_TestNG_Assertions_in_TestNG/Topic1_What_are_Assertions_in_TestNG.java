	//if you simply write the flow then it is flow. You are not asserting anything or validating anything
	
	//TestNG has specific validation or assertion entities which are very powerful
	
	//Assertions in TestNG: -
	//1. Hard Assert. This is called Assert but we tend to use the word Hard
	//2. Soft Assert
	
	//Assert is a pre-defined class in TestNG Library
	//SoftAssert is also a pre-defined class in TestNG Library
