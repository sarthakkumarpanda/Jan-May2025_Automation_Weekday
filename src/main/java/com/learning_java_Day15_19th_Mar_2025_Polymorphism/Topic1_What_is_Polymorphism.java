	//Poly - means many
	//Morphism - means forms
	
	//So polymorphism means many forms
	
	//Types of polymorphism in java
	
	//1. CompileTime Polymorphism / Static Polymorphism / Static Binding / Method Overloading
	
	//How to achieve Method Overloading?
	//Criteria 1: Method name should be the same
	//Criteria 2: Should be in the same class
	//Criteria 3: Parameters/Arguments should be different
	
	//2. RunTime Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism / Dynamic Binding / Method Overriding
	
	//How to achieve Method Overriding?
	//Criteria 1: Method name should be the same
	//Criteria 2: Class name should be different
	//Criteria 3: Parameters/Arguments should be the same
	//Criteria 4: Inheritance has to be there
