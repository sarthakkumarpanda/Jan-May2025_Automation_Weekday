	//Inheritance is inheriting properties of the Parent class into Child class
	//Child Object acquires all the properties of the Parent Object
	//represents IS-A relationship which is known as Parent-Child relationship
	
	//Let's say parent Class is Animal
	//Dog IS-A Animal
	//Cow IS-A Animal
	//Cat IS-A Animal
	
	
	//Let's say parent class is Doctor
	//Surgeon             IS-A Doctor
	//Medicine Specialist IS-A Doctor
	
	//Advantages of Inheritance
	//1. Code reusability
	//2. Promotes run time Polymorphism[method overriding]
	
	//Which entities do not take part in inheritance
	// private members
	// constructors
	// final entities
	
	//Types of inheritance
	//1. Single - One Child extends One Parent
	//2. Multilevel - GrandParent is extended by Parent which is extended by Child
	//3. Heirarchical - One parent class is extended by Multiple Child Classes
