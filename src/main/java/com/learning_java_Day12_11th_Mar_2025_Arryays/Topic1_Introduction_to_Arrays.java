	//Arrays are nothing but data storage houses
	//Arrays are part of Data Structures
	//Arrays will store homogeneous elements[data of the same type]
	//Size of the array is pre-determined
	//Indexing position of array starts from zero
	//Arrays are represented in form of dimension []
	//Parent class of array is Object Class
	//Length(size) of the array is determined using the length attribute

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		//Store 10 integers
		
		int a[] = {10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100};
		
		//Store 5 Strings
		
		String s[] = {"Java", "Python", "PHP", "Perl", "Javascript"};
		
		//Store some boolean values
		
		boolean b[] = { 1<2, true, 3!=2, 2==2, false, 1<2};
		
	}
	
	//Advantages of Array
	//Save time, save memory, store multiple elements
	//Arrays have indexing position, so accessing the values inside the array becomes easy
	
	
	//Let's say there are n elements in an array
	//first value of the firs element will have 0th index
	//last value will have (n-1)th index
