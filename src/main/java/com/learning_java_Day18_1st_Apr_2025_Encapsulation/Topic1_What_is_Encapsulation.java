	//Bundling of data (variables, methods) that operate within a single Unit(Class)
	//Hiding implementation details of a Class from outside access
	//Whatever access you want to give - that is upto the developer
	
	
	//How to achieve this in java?
	//1. All the instance variables - we declare them as private. Private members can only be accessed within the Class
	//2. To allow outside entities access the instance variables, we use typical methods known as (getters and setters)
	
	
	//Why even are we doing this ?
	//Data Hiding [increase security]
	//Class can enforce its own validation rules
