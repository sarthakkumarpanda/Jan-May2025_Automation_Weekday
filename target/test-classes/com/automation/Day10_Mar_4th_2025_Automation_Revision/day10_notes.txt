Understanding WebElements

first you need to understand DOM (Document Object Model)

html - hypertext markup language

basically falls under a family

Parent has a child
that child has more children

html has tags
<openingatag>..........content......</closingtag>


<html>
 <head>.......</head>
 <body>........</body>
</html>

head and body are siblings to each other


3 brothers

<parent> 
  <Elder Brother>......tall, blonde, athlete, smart, rich, single.... </Elder Brother>
  <Middle Brother>......medium, dark, fat, shrewed, poor, complicated...</Middle Brother>
  <Younger Brother>.....short, tan, wellbuilt, powerlifter, average....</Younger Brother>
</parent>

elder brother precedes other siblings
younger brother follows other siblings
